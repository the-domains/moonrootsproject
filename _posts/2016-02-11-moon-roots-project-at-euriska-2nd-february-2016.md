# Moon Roots Project at Euriska - 2nd February 2016\.

Slammed Euriska on the 2nd of February while opening for one of the most renowned acts in the country, Ankytrixx.  
The club saw an early walk in which is rare in Pune and the crowd stuck to the dance floor for 5 hours straight and continued for another 3 once Ankytrixx took over.

Next up - Euriska 14th February opening for Lee Foss & Moog Conspiracy.
