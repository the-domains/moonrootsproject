            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>moonrootsproject</h1><p>Moon Roots Project is a hunt by two siblings for their love of sound. Fatema & Hannan Hakim are constantly evolving their own sounds and re-working already produced tracks into their own fabric. Being strong headed siblings they have still found a middle ground on the sound scape they would like to project. Having started in late 2014, this duo has played at clubs in Mumbai such as Boveda & China 1. In Pune at Euriska, Irish Village Brewery, The little Door & Kiva. They have opened for artistʼs such as Blot! (India) and Dead Heat (Berlin). They also played at the silent disco at one of Indiaʼs most talked about electronic music festival ‘The Lost Partyʼ.  Their sounds ranges from Deep House to Trance / However they have their own unique way to surprise a dance floor making sure that the crowd keeps looking forward to them performing.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b4e01630-f8e3-44ea-a2a9-a3ed5f11a45a.jpg"></article>]]></description>
